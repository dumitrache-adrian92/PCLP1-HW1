Homework assignment consisting of 4 medium-high difficulty exercises mostly meant to test programming basics. All exercises consist of some sort of game from chess to anagrams and are not graded on efficiency as that was not the point of the course (the point was to get as comfortable as possible with things like loops, calculating values, arrays and multidimensional arrays, even 6 dimensions in case of the third exercise).

The first problem asks us to read pairs of words and determine if they're anagrams while also computing how strong they are as anagrams (as in, how many letter are in different positions). At the end you're supposed to print all pairs sorted by grade which I achieved using the direct insertion method after determining the grade of each pair.

The second problem is about computing whether some bishops on a chess table are attacking each other or not and a side computation that's supposed to figure out if there is a possible move such that, if there is only a pair of bishops attacking each other, no bishops will still be attacking each other.

The third problem is about simulating rubik's cube moves, can't say I'm too proud of my solution, but it does work and it can simulate any number of moves by representing the rubik's cube as a 6-dimensional matrix.

Lastly, we have a problem that's all about matrix traversal and even a little bit of boolean matrix multiplication asking us to compute some X and O scores.
